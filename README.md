## üìñ Overview

> [!NOTE]
>
> This project is targetted at users who only work from a Windows machine, and therefor only tested with Ubuntu 22.04 Server.  If you are running Mac and Linux already, you'll have to [configure the compiler and libaries](#) from source yourself.

Historically, managing Tibia private servers involved manually setting up and maintaining [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), and [PHPMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) on Windows machines, which required direct intervention for troubleshooting and service management.  Often this meant to develop and test new code, you would have to creates sets of the web server stack and code to develop on... which becomes very cumbersome.

Although the open source Tibia dev community hasn't transitioned entirely into a microservice architectures - they are beginning to port services to Linux and supporting [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).  This offers significant advantages by decoupling services into independent containers, enhancing fault tolerance, scalability, and deployment consistency. Additionally, using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) for configuring development and test environments automates setup tasks, ensures consistency across environments, and reduces manual errors.

This repository contains all the information required to set up a test/dev environment and simplify compiling.  The Ansible [playbook](ansible\bootstrap\playbooks\initialise.yml) and scripts in the project will take you through creating a VM on your Windows machine that runs [Ubuntu 22.04 desktop](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/).  You will be able to work on your own isolated copy of the latest server, client, launcher and login proxy without haven't to go through too much effort to set anything up initially.  Beyond setting up just the server repositories and developer environment, it also configures what's described in the article ["My First 5 Minutes On A Server; Or, Essential Security for Linux Servers"](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112012219/https://plusbryan.com/my-first-5-minutes-on-a-server-or-essential-security-for-linux-servers).

### Ansible
For a brief rundown on what Ansible is and what it's used for see [here](https://pronteff.com/understanding-ansible-concepts/).

## Requirements

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you are new to developing, follow this [guide](#New-to-git) first, then return here. 

Prior to executing any playbooks, you are required to set up a managed node (a Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 VM using VMWare Workstation) and a control node (your current machine with some small software installations).  

### Setting up your control node

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/tibia-oce/bootstrap.git && cd bootstrap
    ```

1. Install 'task' (this will be used to shortcut a number of commands throughout this project)
    ```bash
    sudo snap install task --classic
    ```

1. Install python and launch a virtual environment to set up Ansible (this may take a few minutes).
    ```bash
    # The password prompt is for your VM
    task environment:python
    ```

### Setting up your managed node (Ubuntu Desktop 22.04)

> [!NOTE]
>
> When selecting a folder to install to, use the `vm` folder that was created in the [starter guide](#New-to-git).

Typically you would [PXE boot](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/p4v4w4/eli5_pxe_boot_how_do_i_simply_install_ubuntu_from/) a group of machines automatically using another service.. but even ansible is overkill for this project so we are manually installing a VM.

1. Firstly, download and install [VMWare](https://softwareupdate.vmware.com/cds/vmw-desktop/ws/17.5.1/23298084/windows/core/).

2. After that, create a new VM in VMWare with an AMD64 ISO from [here](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/). 

3. When setting up the profile for the first time, set:
    - username: ```user```
    - password: ```password```
    - storage size: ```45gb```
    - cpu: ```4 cores```
    - memmory: ```6gb```

4. If you didn't enable this during your Ubuntu installation, set up the SSH server so that your control machine can talk to your managed node via SSH.
    ```
    # Open a 'terminal' from the app manager and run:
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openssh-server
    sudo systemctl start ssh
    sudo systemctl enable ssh
    ```

5. Then find the IP address of the VM
    ```sh
    # To copy from a VM it's often easiest to right click and select copy
    ip addr show ens33 | grep -oP 'inet \K[\d.]+'
    ```

<br>

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
>
> Secrets are contained in an encrypted ansible yaml that can be repackaged to your choosing. By default the vault password is 'password'.  If you would like to improve the security, you can [rekey the vault](#Updating-secrets) with something more reasonable/secure, and also update the values for the root and dev user of the ubuntu server.

### Copy required configs

1. Back on your control machine, we'll generate a signed SSH key and place the tail in your control node so that after this process, your VM is secured:
    ```sh
    # Enter your VM IP address from above (optional: user)
    task environment:keys host=
    ```

2. This task will copy the dummy secrets and host name files.  It will update the host list with the value you provide. 
    ```sh
    # Enter your VM IP address from above
    task secrets:copy host=
    ```

### Running the playbook

> [!NOTE]
>
> Depending on how much RAM and CPU you have allocated the VM, this may run for up to 15 minutes.

3. Then, trigger the playbook to run via:
    ```sh
    # By default, vault password is 'password'
    task ansible:run
    ```

<br>

## Additional

### Cleanup

1. Remove WSL Ubuntu installation:
```wsl --unregister Ubuntu```

### Updating secrets

If you would like to improve the security, you can rekey the vault with something more reasonable/secure, and also update the values for the root and dev user of the ubuntu server.  Most of these scripts are idempotent and configurable, so you can go back through the entire process again after creating a new VM with a different set of credentials and simply pass the new values.

```sh
# Optional
task secrets:rekey # used to update the vault password
task secrets:edit # opens a vim editor to change secrets used for deployments
```

### Tunnelling

Now that the web-server, game-server, database and proxy are configured, you can create a tunnel from your main operating machine to the linux vm (if you'd prefer to run the windows client or browse the services from your Windows side).
```sh
# Open a new terminal in the managed machine and run:
ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 -L 7171:localhost:7171 -L 7172:localhost:7172 -L 22:localhost:22 -L 3306:localhost:3306 $SERVER_USER@$SERVER_IP
```

## New to git

Because Ansible requires a bash environment (used by Mac or Linux), we'll be using WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux) on Windows, to allow us to use Linux applications and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows.  This is different from the VM WorkStation we will be setting up later!

### Tips

While working through the docs, anything you see in a highlighted box like this, can be copied and pasted directly into the terminal you are working in.

### Setting up the minimum requirements for windows

> [!NOTE]
>
> After installing WSL and Git you typically have to restart your machine a few times for the software to take effect and run Windows updates.

1. To work through this repository you will require first installing [Git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.46.0.windows.1/Git-2.46.0-64-bit.exe).


1. Open PowerShell as Administrator (Start menu > PowerShell > right-click > Run as Administrator) and enter this command:
    
    ```
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
    ```

1. Install [Ubuntu through WSL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDXGNCFSCZV?ocid=pdpshare).  Use the Microsoft Store link to simplify the process. After installing Ubuntu, you will need to restart you machine, if you aren't already prompted to. 

![copy](docs/src/assets/images/wsl.png)

4. After restarting your machine.. Run Ubuntu (Start menu > Ubuntu). Follow the prompts to create a user. To simplify following this guide, set the password as `password`.

5. Next, we'll create a project directory to store the code and installations into. Create a folder in your Documents named 'Projects', then inside it, create another folder called "vm" **(copy the path of the Project folder not vm)**.

![pwd](docs/src/assets/images/pwd.png)

6. Navigate the powershell terminal to the folder by using:
    ```cd [PASTE PATH AFTER A SPACE]```

7. Activate your WSL environment

    ```bash
    wsl -d Ubuntu
    ```

8. You are now ready to continue on with the rest of the [installation guide](#Setting-up-your-control-node).
